    <p>I created this recipe as an attempt to capture all of the intense meaty flavor of an all-day slow-simmered rag&ugrave; but with the ease and speed of a pressure cooker. Sometimes you just want that Sunday pasta on a Wednesday.</p>

    <p>This recipe takes all of those same flavors and ingredients and concentrats them using the power of a pressure cooker. You can use any pressure cooker you have, but I find electronic pressure cookers like the Instant Pot to be both easiesr and with more consistent results than their stove-top counterparts.</p>
